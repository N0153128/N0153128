# N0153128
Backend-focused developer who loves solving tough problems and writing clean, scalable code ⚙️
I work with Python/Django, Node.js, and Java (OpenCV, Jave2). I thrive on automation, APIs, algorithms, and all things server-side 🚀

I’m always learning, improving, and aiming to build something of my own one day.
If you like high-focus engineering and meaningful projects—let’s build cool stuff together 🤝
