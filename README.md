I'm a backend-first software developer with a passion for turning complex problems into clean, maintainable code. Over the years, I’ve built projects in Python (Django), JavaScript (Node.js) and Java (OpenCV, Jave2). I thrive when working on the core logic, automation, APIs and data flows.

Fast-learning, analytically minded, and detail-oriented, I love diving into algorithmic challenges and engineering solutions that scale. One of my proudest traits is the ability to go deep solo—researching, planning, coding—yet I’m always open to collaborating when the project demands rich exchange of ideas.

Currently, I’m focused on backend architecture and the server-side of applications: everything from database design, performance tuning, to building microservices and RESTful endpoints. My goal is to accumulate real-world experience, sharpen my tool-kit, and eventually launch my own company—so I can build products I believe in and enjoy working on.

If you’re looking for someone who relishes well-defined tasks, high brain-intensity projects, minimal overhead, and a drive toward excellence—let’s connect and build something meaningful.
